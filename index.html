            <p>I think my greatest strength is my ability to learn. 
                I feel very happy when I discover something new about my interests. 
                Constantly asking “why” about everything helps me solve problems and make difficult things easier.</p>
            
            <p>I work as a reporter, which has brought my curiosity back. 
                Outside of work I enjoy walking, taking photos and building things. 
                I mostly create digital projects but I like to do anything that interests me.
                And I love simplicity</p>
