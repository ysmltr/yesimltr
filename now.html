                furkanworks was fun but I didn't have enough 
                time and patience to code workplaces but I don't want to ruin this idea I will do it in the first quarter of 2025 I swear
            </p>

            <p>
                My last update was I made $7.98 from my small internet business 
                and now I proudly announce that I made ($806 but I had to spend it on driving license lessons and exams and unfortunately I failed and had an accident (hit by a motorbike lol) but I believe I can earn more than that, even if I don't I will do different things, I don't know, I don't like to plan too much 'mostly do and see' 
                is my tactic (but my anxiety affects me sometimes and that's why I can't finish things)
            </p>

            <p>
                I didn't finish David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs (I couldn't pay attention enough) but 
                I did finish Morgan Housel's The Psychology Of Money and Yanılgının İcadı - Abdullah Reha Nazlı , these books were great, 
                I'm so glad I read them and I'm currently reading The Invisible Gorilla by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons.
