                furkanworks is done, but unfortunately I couldn't finish the workplace web project because 
                it feels stupid to do so but I promise it will be ready this year.

                "I also forced myself to earn my first internet dollar through Google AdSense probably by the end of this year." 
                I'M SO HAPPY I MADE MY FIRST INTERNET DOLLAR($7.98(Made by my lil internet job which provides temporary and unstable income))

                I keep reading David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs Recently, 
                I've been watching The Substance and it's overrated actually and 
                I also watched badhaai do (a queer movie and actually a good movie that everyone should watch)
